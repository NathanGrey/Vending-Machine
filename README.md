# Vending-Machine
Description
You will be writing a simple vending machine program. Apply all aspects of functions to complete the assignment. You'll use Visual Studio to create a new project. As well as Visual Studio to code, edit, and build this assignment.

Requirements:

Create a Visual Studio project. Naming convention for project: [yourlastname]_4
Create vending_machine.cpp file in the new project.
Project must build and compile without any errors.
Must meet runtime specifications.
Specifications:

The vending machines offers the following categories of foods:
Beverages
Baked Goods
Fruits
Candy
The first prompt should look like:
[Welcome message you customize here]
Main Menu:
1. Beverages
2. Baked Goods
3. Fruits
4. Candy
5. Exit
Choose a category:

All categories other than "Exit" should contain 3â€“5 items. Use your favorite foods or items from the categories above. Each will need to have a price set. The categories should each print out like so:
Beverages.
1. Nuka Cola          - 1.99
2. Duff Beer            - 4.99
3. The Plasmid       - 4.99
Choose a drink:

"Exit" should print out a goodbye message to the user and terminate the program.
You should use functions to reduce code duplication. Just to get you started, here are some thing you should have functions for:
Printing menus
Handling user input
Exiting/printing goodbye
Printing total price
Runtime Specifications:

When the program is run, the user should be prompted with the Main <
Menu (see specifications section above).
If "Exit" is chosen, the program should terminate after printing a goodbye message to the user.
If a food category is chosen, then the user should be presented with a sub-menu with items and their prices.
Once an item is chosen in the sub-menu, the user should be prompted with how much they are charged and a goodbye message.
Then the application should be terminated.
